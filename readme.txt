Easily manage the data for a color guard circuit (or similar sport/activity organization) with WordPress.

== Description ==
Ensemble is a game-changing solution for running a color guard or other alternative sports circuit using WordPress. Finally, all of the data you need in one place, and it’s all tied together: venues, contests, seasons, units, unit directors, and more.

Note: Ensemble serves only as the data layer. There are a wide variety of rich connections between the data, which can be managed via the WordPress admin, but this plugin serves only to create an entry point for tying all of that data together.

A sister theme is in the works to bring all of this to the front end in the near future.

= Contests =

Contests are central to how Ensemble works. They’re tied to venues and seasons, which are in-turn tied to everything else.

= Venue Management =

Being able to manage canonical venue data is what ultiamtely allows for so much work to be done once instead of once every season.

= Competing Units =

Units are the heart and soul of any sports activity, and Ensemble has designed them to be super easy to tie in to everything.

= Unit Directors =

People management is important too – this first version of Ensemble has a Unit Director component baked in from the start.

= Season & Time Management =

Season creation with start and end dates means no more confusion about which contests are current and which have already passed.

= What's Next? =

Integrations will be coming soon in the form of sister theme for the front-end and support for popular calendar & eCommerce solutions.
